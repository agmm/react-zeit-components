## Disclaimer

**I DO NOT OWN** any of these designs and **I DID NOT CREATE** them. These designs where created by [Zeit](https://zeit.co/) and [evilrabbit](https://evilrabb.it/) and belong to them only.

I'm just fascinated with [Zeit's design](https://zeit.co/design) and wanted to use their components in my personal projects, so I ported them to React. I couldn't find any license thing so I hope there isn't a problem, if there is one, please let me know.

I love what [Zeit](https://zeit.co/) is doing and so should you, check them out.
